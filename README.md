## Overview

This Apple clone was my first individual assignment. The task was to create a custom-built dynamic webshop using PHP. You can order items and accessories, view your shopping cart, and place an order.

1. Front-end (`/index.html`)

   - The homepage of the Apple iPhone webshop.
   - Uses JavaScript for certain features and animations and PHP for the back-end.
